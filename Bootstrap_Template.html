        <h1>HISTORY OF APPLE PRODUCT</h1>
        <p> Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is a multinational corporation that creates consumer electronics, personal computers, servers, and computer software, and is a digital distributor of media content. The company also has a chain of retail
            stores known as Apple Stores. Apple's core product lines are the iPhone smartphone, iPad tablet computer, iPod portable media players, and Macintosh computer line. Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple Computer on April 1, 1976,[1]
            and incorporated the company on January 3, 1977,[2] in Cupertino, California. For more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it
            faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1997 after his company NeXT was bought by Apple.[3] The following year he became the company's interim CEO,[4]
            which later became permanent.[5] Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998. With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001
            and iTunes Music Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop "Computer" from the company's name in 2007. The company is now also known for its iOS range of
            smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of 30 June 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization,[6] with
            an estimated value of US$1</p>
        <h1>PREFOUNDER</h1>
        <p>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak first met in mid-1971, when their mutual friend, Bill Fernandez, introduced then 21-year-old Wozniak to 16-year-old Jobs.[10][11] Their first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak, a self-educated
            electronics engineer, started to build his original “blue boxes” that enabled one to make long-distance phone calls at no cost.[12] Jobs managed to sell some two hundred blue boxes for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.[10][11]
            Jobs later told his biographer that if it hadn't been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an Apple."[13] Jobs and Wozniak, also referred to collectively as "the two Steves", had withdrawn from Reed College and UC Berkeley respectively
            by 1975. Wozniak designed a video terminal that he could use to log on to the minicomputers at Call Computer. Alex Kamradt commissioned the design and sold a small number of them through his firm. Aside from their interest in up-to-date technology,
            the impetus for the two Steves seems to have had another source. In his essay From Satori to Silicon Valley (published 1986), cultural historian Theodore Roszak made the point that the Apple Computer emerged from within the West Coast counterculture
            and the need to produce print-outs, letter labels, and databases. Roszak offers a bit of background on the development of the two Steves' prototype models. In 1975, the two Steves started attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club.[14]
            New microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 and the IMSAI inspired Wozniak to build a microprocessor into his video terminal and have a complete computer. At the time the only microcomputer CPUs generally available were the $179 Intel 8080
            (equivalent to $850 in 2019), and the $170 Motorola 6800 (equivalent to $808 in 2019). Wozniak preferred the 6800, but both were out of his price range. So he watched, and learned, and designed computers on paper, waiting for the day he could
            afford a CPU. When MOS Technology released its $20 (equivalent to $90 in 2019) 6502 chip in 1976, Wozniak wrote a version of BASIC for it, then began to design a computer for it to run on. The 6502 was designed by the same people who designed
            the 6800, as many in Silicon Valley left employers to form their own companies. Wozniak's earlier 6800 paper-computer needed only minor changes to run on the new chip. By March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the machine and took it to a Homebrew
            Computer Club meeting to show it off.[15] When Jobs saw Wozniak's computer, which would later become known as the Apple I, he was immediately interested in its commercial potential.[16] Initially, Wozniak intended to share schematics of the
            machine for free, but Jobs insisted that they should instead build and sell bare printed circuit boards for the computer.[17] Wozniak also originally offered the design to Hewlett-Packard (HP), where he worked at the time, but was denied by
            the company on five occasions.[18] Jobs eventually convinced Wozniak to go into business together and start a new company of their own.[19] In order to raise the money they needed to produce the first batch of printed circuit boards, Jobs
            sold his Volkswagen Type 2 minibus for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 programmable calculator for $500.[17][15][20][21]</p>
